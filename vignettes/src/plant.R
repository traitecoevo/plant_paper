## This vignette covers the sort of analysis in the plant figure in
## the manuscript.  It also shows some of the features of working
## with plant components of the model.
library(tree)

## Plants are constructed with the `FFW16_Plant` function.  That
## function takes as its only argument a "strategy" object; the
## default is `FFW16_Strategy`, but alternative strategies can be
## provided (see below)
pl <- FFW16_Plant()

## Plants are an [R6](https://github.com/wch/R6) class, and have a
## number of elements and fields that can be accessed:
pl

## Things labelled 'active binding' are "fields" and can be read from
## and (sometimes) set:
pl$height
pl$height <- 10
pl$height

pl$fecundity
pl$mortality

## Height, fecundity and mortality are the three key variables
## propagated by the system of differential equations:
pl$ode_state

## To compute rates of change for these variables we need a light
## environment.  The function `fixed_environment` creates an
## environment that has the same light level (here 100%) at all
## heights.  The plant *does not affect* this light environment.
env <- fixed_environment(1.0)

## The `compute_vars_phys` method computes whole-plant assmilation for
## the plant, and from that growth rates:
pl$ode_rates
pl$compute_vars_phys(env)
pl$ode_rates

## Some internals from the calculations are available in the
## `internals` field:
names(pl$internals)

## Height growth rate
pl$internals$height_dt

## Leaf area (m^2)
pl$internals$area_leaf

## There's not actually that much that can be done with Plant
## objects; they're designed to be small and light to work well with
## the larger simulation code that does not particularly care about
## most of the internal calculations.
##
## Because of this, we have a "PlantPlus" object that exposes more of
## a strategy (NOTE: a little more than this because it also includes
## stem diameter growth)
pp <- FFW16_PlantPlus(pl$strategy)
pp$compute_vars_phys(env)
names(pp$internals)

## Some of the internals require `compute_vars_internals` to be run:
pp$compute_vars_growth()
zapsmall(unlist(pp$internals))

## This PlantPlus object also includes diameter and heartwood as two
## more variables for the ODE system (this might move into Plant
## soon -- see [this issue](https://github.com/traitecoevo/tree/issues/139)).
pp$ode_names

## Plants are a type of *reference object*.  They are different to
## almost every other R object you regularly interact with in that
## they do not make copies when you rename them.  So changes to one
## will be reflected in another.
pl2 <- pl
pl2$height <- 1
pl2$height
pl$height # also 1!

## # Growing plants

## Rather than setting plant physical sizes to given values, it will
## often be required to *grow* them to a size.  This is required to
## compute seed output (integrated over the plant's lifetime)
## diameter, mortality risk, etc; basically everything except for
## height.
##
## It's possible to directly integrate the equations exposed by the
## plant, using the `ode_state` field, `compute_vars_phys` method and
## `ode_rates` field.  For example, for use with `deSolve`:
derivs <- function(t, y, plant, env) {
  plant$ode_state <- y
  plant$compute_vars_phys(env)
  list(plant$ode_rates)
}
pl <- FFW16_Plant()
tt <- seq(0, 50, length.out=101)
y0 <- setNames(pl$ode_state, pl$ode_names)
yy <- deSolve::lsoda(y0, tt, derivs, pl, env=env)
plot(height ~ time, yy, type="l")

## Alternatively, it might desirable to grow a plant to a particular
## size.  We could interpolate from the previous results easily
## enough.  E.g., to find a plant with height of 15 m:
h <- 15.0

## that happened approximately here:
t <- spline(yy[, "height"], yy[, "time"], xout=h)$y

## Interpolate to find the state:
y <- apply(yy[, -1], 2, function(y) spline(yy[, "time"], y, xout=t)$y)

pl2 <- FFW16_Plant()
pl2$ode_state <- y
pl2$compute_vars_phys(env)
## Plant is expected height:
pl2$height
## And at this height, here is the total seed production:
pl2$fecundity

res <- grow_plant_to_time(FFW16_PlantPlus(FFW16_Strategy()), tt, env)

## Here is the results, plotted against the `deSolve` results from
## before:
plot(height ~ tt, res$state, type="l", las=1,
     xlab="Time (years)", ylab="Height (m)")
points(height ~ time, yy, col="grey", cex=.5)

## Completing the set, `tree` also provides a function for growing
## plants to a particular size; `grow_plant_to_size`.  This takes
## *any* size measurement in the plant and can grow the plant to that
## size.  So, for height:

pl <- FFW16_PlantPlus(FFW16_Strategy())
heights <- seq(pl$height, pl$strategy$hmat, length.out=20)
res <- grow_plant_to_size(pl, heights, "height", env)

## This returns a vector of times; this is when the heights were
## achieved
res$time

## A matrix of state:
head(res$state)

## And a list of plants
res$plant[[10]]
res$plant[[10]]$height
heights[[10]]

## Also included is `trajectory`; the points that the ODE stepper used
## with the system state at those times.

## There is a conveinence function `run_plant_to_heights` that
## achieves the same thing.  Alternatively, and variable within
## `plant$internals` can be used, so long as it increases
## monotonically with respect to time.
pl <- FFW16_PlantPlus(FFW16_Strategy())
mass <- seq_log(pl$internals$mass_above_ground + 1e-8, 1000, length.out=21)
res_mass <- grow_plant_to_size(pl, mass, "mass_above_ground", env,
                               time_max=100, warn=FALSE)
## (this seems on the low side - see [this
## issue](https://github.com/traitecoevo/tree/issues/142)).
plot(res_mass$time, mass, type="o", pch=19, las=1, xlab="Time (years)")

## With all these bits in place, let's look at growth trajectories of
## two species that differ in their LMA values.

p <- ebt_base_parameters()
## Low LMA ("fast growth") species
s1 <- strategy(trait_matrix(0.08,  "lma"), p)
## High LMA ("low growth") species
s2 <- strategy(trait_matrix(0.267, "lma"), p)

## Note that we're using an alternative way of specifying strategies
## here, to trigger our "hyperparametrisation" approach.  This may be
## simplified in future, but currently it resides on the `p` object.

## Then, generate a sequence of heights to collect information at
pl1 <- FFW16_PlantPlus(s1)
pl2 <- FFW16_PlantPlus(s2)

## (they are different for the two plants because they have different
## starting heights due to some allometric scalings)
heights1 <- seq(pl1$height, s1$hmat, length.out=100L)
heights2 <- seq(pl2$height, s2$hmat, length.out=100L)

dat1 <- grow_plant_to_height(pl1, heights1, env,
                             time_max=100, warn=FALSE, filter=TRUE)
dat2 <- grow_plant_to_height(pl2, heights2, env,
                             time_max=100, warn=FALSE, filter=TRUE)

plot(dat1$trajectory[, "time"], dat1$trajectory[, "height"],
     type="l", lty=1,
     las=1, xlab="Time (years)", ylab="Height (m)")
lines(dat2$trajectory[, "time"], dat2$trajectory[, "height"], lty=2)
legend("bottomright", c("Low LMA", "High LMA"), lty=1:2, bty="n")

## Similarly, growing the plants under lower light:
env_low <- fixed_environment(0.5)
dat1_low <- grow_plant_to_height(pl1, heights1, env_low,
                                 time_max=100, warn=FALSE, filter=TRUE)
dat2_low <- grow_plant_to_height(pl2, heights2, env_low,
                                 time_max=100, warn=FALSE, filter=TRUE)

cols <- c("black", "#e34a33")
plot(dat1$trajectory[, "time"], dat1$trajectory[, "height"],
     type="l", lty=1,
     las=1, xlab="Time (years)", ylab="Height (m)")
lines(dat2$trajectory[, "time"], dat2$trajectory[, "height"], lty=2)
lines(dat1_low$trajectory[, "time"], dat1_low$trajectory[, "height"],
      lty=1, col=cols[[2]])
lines(dat2_low$trajectory[, "time"], dat2_low$trajectory[, "height"],
      lty=2, col=cols[[2]])
legend("bottomright",
       c("High light", "Low light"), lty=1, col=cols,
       bty="n")

## The *height growth rate* is the derivative of height with respect
## to time - the slope of the plot above.  It is really the core
## quantity in the model; the actual heights are computed by solving
## the set of ODEs that includes height growth rate.

## Growth rate with respect to height shows a hump-shaped pattern that
## is affected by both traits and by light environment.  To extract
## this information from the trajectories takes a little more work
## though.

## Here is a plant from part way through one run
pl <- dat1$plant[[50]]
## Here is the set of ODE state variables:
setNames(pl$ode_state, pl$ode_names)
## And the set of *rate* variables
setNames(pl$ode_rates, pl$ode_names)
## ...however, the rates might not be correct.  They are whatever was
## left by the ODE stepper when it was advancing the plant, so it's
## best to update them:
pl$compute_vars_phys(dat1$env)
setNames(pl$ode_rates, pl$ode_names)
## (in this case they are the same because the light environment is
## unchanging, but that not be the case generally)

## Alternatively, we can access the height growth rate via the
## internals, which is the same as accessing directly from the ODE
## rates but more explicit:
pl$internals$height_dt
pl$ode_rates[[1]]

## Collecting height growth for all plants:
dhdt1 <- sapply(dat1$plant, function(x) x$internals$height_dt)
dhdt2 <- sapply(dat2$plant, function(x) x$internals$height_dt)
dhdt1_low <- sapply(dat1_low$plant, function(x) x$internals$height_dt)
dhdt2_low <- sapply(dat2_low$plant, function(x) x$internals$height_dt)

plot(dat1$time, dhdt1, type="l", lty=1,
     las=1, xlab="Time (years)", ylab="Height growth rate (m / yr)")
lines(dat2$time, dhdt2, lty=2)
lines(dat1_low$time, dhdt1_low, lty=1, col=cols[[2]])
lines(dat2_low$time, dhdt2_low, lty=2, col=cols[[2]])
legend("topright",
       c("High light", "Low light"), lty=1, col=cols,
       bty="n")

## Alternatively, change in height plotted against height itself:
ylim <- c(0, max(dhdt1))
plot(dat1$state[, "height"], dhdt1, type="l", lty=1,
     las=1, xlab="Height (m)", ylab="Height growth rate (m / yr)", ylim=ylim)
lines(dat2$state[, "height"], dhdt2, lty=2)
lines(dat1_low$state[, "height"], dhdt1_low, lty=1, col=cols[[2]])
lines(dat2_low$state[, "height"], dhdt2_low, lty=2, col=cols[[2]])
legend("topright",
       c("High light", "Low light"), lty=1, col=cols,
       bty="n")

## Over a plant's life, allocation to different structures varies.
## This is captured by a set of variables stored within the internals:
## e.g., `mass_leaf` `mass_sapwood`.
pl$internals$mass_leaf
pl$internals$mass_sapwood

## (these numbers seem a bit off: one of the motivations here is to
## develop and use better models of plant allometry.  The
## parameterisations used at present are derived from adults and
## perform poorly with small plants.  However, based on height / area
## relationships [Falster 2011, supporting information], for an 8m
## tall plant total leaf areas of 5-10 m are plausible and with an LMA
## of 0.08 that implies a total *dry* weight of 400 - 800 g).

## Total live dry mass fraction to leaf and stem can be computed as:
f <- function(p) {
  p_ints <- p$internals
  c(leaf=p_ints$mass_leaf / p_ints$mass_live,
    sapwood=p_ints$mass_sapwood / p_ints$mass_live)
}

cols_part <- c("black", "#045a8d")
matplot(dat1$state[, "height"], t(sapply(dat1$plant, f)),
        type="l", col=cols_part, lty=1, ylim=c(0, 1),
        xlab="Height (m)", ylab="Fractional allocation", las=1)
matlines(dat2$state[, "height"], t(sapply(dat2$plant, f)),
         col=cols_part, lty=2)
legend("topright", c("Sapwood", "Leaf"), lty=1, col=rev(cols_part), bty="n")

## Relative allocation to leaf mass drops steeply as a plant grows and
## is replaced by allocation to sapwood mass.

## The growth rates vary with both size and light environment (see
## above).

pl <- FFW16_PlantPlus()
pl$height <- 10
pl$compute_vars_phys(fixed_environment(1.0))
pl$internals$height_dt # in full light

pl$compute_vars_phys(fixed_environment(0.5))
pl$internals$height_dt # in 1/2 light

## At some point the plant cannot maintain positive carbon balance and
## therefore cannot grow; for example at 25% canopy openness:
pl$compute_vars_phys(fixed_environment(0.25))
pl$internals$height_dt

## The light level at which carbon gain becomes zero is the "whole
## plant light compensation point".
lcp_whole_plant(pl)

## Consider a vector of canopy opennesses:
openness <- seq(0, 1, length.out=51)

lcp <- lcp_whole_plant(pl)

## Height growth rate increases in a saturating fashion with
## increasing canopy openness from the light compensation point.
f <- function(x, pl) {
  env <- fixed_environment(x)
  pl$compute_vars_phys(env)
  pl$internals$height_dt
}
x <- c(lcp, openness[openness > lcp])
plot(x, sapply(x, f, pl), type="l", xlim=c(0, 1),
     las=1, xlab="Canopy openness", ylab="Height growth rate (m / yr)")
points(lcp, 0.0, pch=19)

g <- function(x, pl) {
  lcp <- lcp_whole_plant(pl)
  x <- c(lcp, openness[openness > lcp])
  cbind(x=x, y=sapply(x, f, pl))
}

## Now, consider this for a seedling and for a plant at half its
## maximum size
## size:
pl_seed <- FFW16_PlantPlus(s1)
y_seed <- g(openness, pl_seed)
pl_adult <- FFW16_PlantPlus(s1)
pl_adult$height <- pl_adult$strategy$hmat / 2
y_adult <- g(openness, pl_adult)
cols_height <- c("#31a354", "black")

ymax <- max(y_seed[, 2], y_adult[, 2])
plot(y_seed, type="l", col=cols_height[[1]],
     xlim=c(0, 1), ylim=c(0, ymax), las=1,
     xlab="Canopy openness", ylab="Height growth year (m / yr)")
lines(y_adult, col=cols_height[[2]])
legend("bottomright", c("Seedling", "Adult"), lty=1, col=cols_height, bty="n")

## The light compensation point and curve varies with traits, too:
pl2_seed <- FFW16_PlantPlus(s2)
pl2_adult <- FFW16_PlantPlus(s2)
pl2_adult$height <- pl2_adult$strategy$hmat / 2
y2_seed <- g(openness, pl2_seed)
y2_adult <- g(openness, pl2_adult)

ymax <- max(ymax, y2_seed[, 2], y2_adult[, 2])
plot(y_seed, type="l", col=cols_height[[1]],
     xlim=c(0, 1), ylim=c(0, ymax), las=1,
     xlab="Canopy openness", ylab="Height growth year (m / yr)")
lines(y_adult, col=cols_height[[2]])
lines(y2_seed, col=cols_height[[1]], lty=2)
lines(y2_adult, col=cols_height[[2]], lty=2)
legend("bottomright", c("Seedling", "Adult"), lty=1, col=cols_height, bty="n")

## Note that the traits with the lowest growth rate in most lights
## while a seedling (dotted lines) has the highest growth rate in all
## lights as an adult.
