\maketitle


The core job of the physiological model in \texttt{TREE} is to take a plant's
current size, light environment and physiological parameters as inputs,
and return it's growth, mortality and fecundity rates. In the default
physiological model within \texttt{TREE}, these vital demographic rates are all
derived from the rate at which living biomass is produced by the plant,
which in turn is calculated based on well understood physiology (Fig.
\ref{fig:schematic-phys}). Various physiological parameters (see Table
\ref{tab:definitions}, \ref{tab:params} for units and definitions)
influence how demographic outcomes. Varying these parameters allows for
species-differences to be included, potentially via traits (see last
section).

\section{Leaf photosynthesis}\label{leaf-photosynthesis}

Let \(p(x,E)\) denote the gross rate of leaf photosynthesis per unit
area at height within the canopy of a plant with traits \(x\) at light
level \(E(z)\). We assume a relationship of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:photosynthesis}
p(x,E(z))=\frac{c_\textrm{p1}}{E(z)+c_\textrm{p2}},
\end{equation}
for the average of \(p\) across the year. The parameters
\(c_\textrm{p1}, c_\textrm{p2}\) alter the shape of curve and can be
derived from a detailed leaf-level model.

The average rate of leaf photosynthesis across the plant is then
\begin{equation}\label{eq:photosynthesis_av}
\bar{p}(x,h,E_a)=\int_0^h p(x,E(z)) \, q(z, h),
\end{equation}
where \(q(z, h)\) gives the density of leaf area at height \(z\) (Eq.
\ref{eq:crown3}).

\section{Standard model for mass
production}\label{standard-model-for-mass-production}

The amount of biomass available for growth,
\(\textrm{d}b / \textrm{d}t\), is given by the difference between income
(total photosynthesis) and losses (respiration and turnover) within the
plant \citep{Makela-1997, Thornley-2000, Falster-2011}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dbdt}
\underbrace{\strut \frac{\textrm{d}b}{\textrm{d}t}}_\textrm{net biomass production}
  = \underbrace{\strut y}_\textrm{yield}
    \big( \underbrace{\strut a_\textrm{l} \, \bar{p}}_\textrm{photosynthesis} -
     \underbrace{\strut \,\sum_\textrm{i=l,b,s,r}{m_\textrm{i} \, r_\textrm{i}}}_\textrm{respiration}\big)
    - \underbrace{\strut \sum_\textrm{i=l,b,s,r}{m_\textrm{i} \, k_\textrm{i}}}_\textrm{turnover}.
\end{equation}
Here, \(m,r\), and \(k\) refer to the mass, respiration rate, and
turnover rate of different tissues, denoted by subscripts \(l\)=leaves,
\(b\)=bark, \(s\)=sapwood and \(r\)=roots. \(A\) is the assimilation
rate of CO\(_2\) per leaf area and \(y\) is yield: the fraction of
assimilated carbon fixed in biomass (the remaining fraction being lost
as growth respiration) (see Table \ref{tab:params} for units and
definitions). Total photosynthesis is proportional to leaf area,
\(a_\textrm{l} = m_\textrm{l} / \phi\), where \(\phi\) is leaf mass per
area. The total mass of living tissues
\(m_\textrm{a}=m_\textrm{l}+m_\textrm{b}+m_\textrm{s}+m_\textrm{r}.\)

\section{Height growth rate}\label{height-growth-rate}

To model growth in height requires that account not just for mass
production, but also for the costs of building new tissues, allocation
to reproduction, and architectural layout. Mathematically, height growth
can be decomposed into a product of physiologically relevant terms
\citep{Falster-2011}:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:dhdt}
\frac{\textrm{d}h}{\textrm{d}t}= \frac{\textrm{d}h}{\textrm{d}a_\textrm{l}}
\times \frac{\textrm{d}a_\textrm{l}}{\textrm{d}m_\textrm{a}}
\times \frac{\textrm{d}m_\textrm{a}}{\textrm{d}b}
\times \frac{\textrm{d}b}{\textrm{d}t}.
\end{equation}

The first term on the right of eq \ref{eq:dhdt},
\(\textrm{d}h / \textrm{d}a_\textrm{l}\), is the growth in plant height
per unit growth in total leaf area -- accounting for the architectural
strategy of the plant. Some species tend to leaf out more than grow
tall, while other species emphasise vertical extension.

The second term in eq \ref{eq:dhdt},
\(\textrm{d}a_\textrm{l} / \textrm{d}m_\textrm{a}\), accounts for the
marginal cost of deploying an additional unit of leaf area, including
construction of the leaf itself and various support structures. As such,
\(\textrm{d}a_\textrm{l} / \textrm{d}m_\textrm{a}\) can itself be
expressed as a sum of construction costs per unit leaf area:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:daldmt}
\frac{\textrm{d}a_\textrm{l}}{\textrm{d}m_\textrm{a}}
= \big(\phi
 + \frac{\textrm{d}m_\textrm{s}}{\textrm{d}a_\textrm{l}} + \frac{\textrm{d}m_\textrm{b}}{\textrm{d}a_\textrm{l}} + \frac{\textrm{d}m_\textrm{r}}{\textrm{d}a_\textrm{l}}\big)^{-1}.
\end{equation}

The third term in eq \ref{eq:dhdt},
\(\textrm{d}m_\textrm{a} / \textrm{d}m_\textrm{b}\), gives the fraction
of net biomass production (eq. \ref{eq:dbdt}) that is allocated to
growth rather than reproduction or storage.

\section{A functional-balance model for
allocation}\label{a-functional-balance-model-for-allocation}

Here we describe an allometric model linking the various size dimensions
of a plant required by most ecologically realistic vegetation models
(i.e. =mass of leaves, mass of sapwood, mass of bark, mass of fine
roots) to a plant's height. This approach allows us to track only the
plant's height, while still accounting for the mass need to build
leaves, roots, and stems. The growth rates of various tissues can then
also be derived (Table \ref{tab:allometry}).

\subsection{Leaf area}\label{leaf-area}

Based on empirically observed allometry, we assume an allometric log-log
scaling relationship between the accumulated leaf area of a plant and
its height:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ha}
a_\textrm{l}=\alpha_1 \, h^{\beta_1}.
\end{equation}

Note, scaling relationship reversed from \citep{Falster-2011}.

\subsection{Vertical distribution of leaf
area}\label{vertical-distribution-of-leaf-area}

We follow the model of \citet{Yokozawa-1995} describing the vertical
distribution of leaf area within the crowns of individual plants. This
model can account for a variety of canopy profiles through a single
parameter \(\eta\). Setting \(\eta=1\) results in a conical canopy, as
seen in many conifers, while higher values, e.g. \(\eta=12\) , gives a
top-weighted canopy profile similar to those seen among angiosperms. Let
\(a_\textrm{s}(z)\) be the sapwood area at height \(z\) for a plant with
top height \(h\), \(a_\textrm{s} =\)a\_\textrm{s}(0)\$ be the sapwood
area at the base of the plant, \(q(z,h)\) the probability density of
leaf area at height \(z\) and \(Q(z,h)\) the cumulative fraction of a
plant's leaf above height \(z\). Following \citet{Yokozawa-1995} we
assume a relationship between \(a_\textrm{s}(z)\) and height such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crown1}
\frac{a_\textrm{s}(z)}{a_\textrm{s}}= \left(1-\left(\frac{z}{h}\right)^\eta\right)^2.
\end{equation}

We also assume that each unit of sapwood area supports a fixed area of
leaf \citep[the pipe model][]{Shinozaki-1964}, so that the total canopy
area of a plant relates to basal sapwood area \(a_\textrm{s}\):
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crown2}
\frac{m_\textrm{l}}{\phi}= \theta \, a_\textrm{s}.
\end{equation}

The pipe model is assumed to hold within individual plants, as well as
across plants of different size. It directly follows that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crown1}
Q(z,h)= \left(1-\left(\frac{z}{h}\right)^\eta\right)^2.
\end{equation}
Differentiating with respect to \(z\) then yields a solution for the
probability density of leaf area as a function of height:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:crown3}
q(z,h)= 2\eta(1-z^\eta h^{-\eta})z^{\eta-1} h^{-\eta}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Mass of sapwood}\label{mass-of-sapwood}

Integrating \(a_\textrm{s}(z)\) gives a solution for the total mass of
sapwood in the plant:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ms1}
m_\textrm{s}=\rho \, \int_0^h \, a_\textrm{s}(z) \, \textrm{d}z= \rho \, a_\textrm{s} \, h \, \eta_c, 
\end{equation}
where \(\eta_c=1-\frac{2}{1+\eta} + \frac{1}{1+2\eta}\)
\citep{Yokozawa-1995}. Substituting from Eq. \ref{eq:crown2} into Eq.
\ref{eq:ms1} then gives an expression for sapwood mass as a function
leaf area and height:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ms2}
m_\textrm{s}=\rho \, \eta_c \, \theta \, a_\textrm{l} \, h.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Bark mass}\label{bark-mass}

Bark and phloem tissue are modelled using an analogue of the pipe model,
leading to a similar equation as that for sapwood mass (Eq.
\ref{eq:ms2}). Cross sectional-area of bark per unit leaf area is
assumed to be a constant fraction \(b\) of sapwood area per unit leaf
area such that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mb}
m_\textrm{b}=b m_\textrm{s}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Root mass}\label{root-mass}

Also consistent with pipe-model assumption, we assume a fixed ratio of
root mass per unit leaf area
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mr}
m_\textrm{r}=\alpha_3 \, a_\textrm{l}.
\end{equation}

Even though nitrogen and water uptake are not modelled explicitly,
imposing a fixed ratio of root mass to leaf area ensures that
approximate costs of root production are included in calculations of
carbon budget.

\section{Seed production}\label{seed-production}

The rate of seed production from the plant \(f(x,h,E_a)\) is a direct
function of mass allocated to reproduction:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fecundity}
f(x,h,E_a) = \frac{(1-\frac{\textrm{d}m_\textrm{a}}{\textrm{d}b}) \times \frac{\textrm{d}b}{\textrm{d}t}}{
  s + c_{\textrm{acc}}},
\end{equation}
where \(s\) is the mass of the seed and \(c_{\textrm{acc}}\) is the cost
per seed of accessories, such as fruits, flowers and dispersal
structures.

\section{Mortality}\label{mortality}

Instantaneous rates of plant mortality are taken as the sum of a growth
independent and growth dependent terms
\citep{Falster-2011, Moorcroft-2001}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mortality}
d(x,h,E_a) = d_{\textrm{I}}(x,h) + d_{\textrm{D}}(x,h,E_a).
\end{equation}

The growth independent rate is taken to be a constant, independent of
plant performance, but potentially varying with species traits. The
growth dependent part is assumed to decline exponentially with the rate
of mass production per unit leaf area, i.e.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:mortality_GD}
d_{\textrm{D}}(x,h,E_a) =  c_{d2}  \exp(-c_{d3} X),
\end{equation}
where \(X = \textrm{d}b / \textrm{d}t / a_\textrm{l}\). This
relationship allows for plants to increase mortality as growth rate
approaches zero, while also allowing for differences among species in
the parameters \(c_{d2}\) and \(c_{d3}\).
