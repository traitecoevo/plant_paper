# Target

Aim is to contribute to special Issue of BES journals aligned with their
symposium [Demography Beyond The Population](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/events/current_future_meetings/demography-beyond-the-population-bes-annual-symposium/)

Demographic methods and population modelling have long provided powerful
approaches for ecologists. Recent advances have expanded the scope of
questions that can be addressed with these tools, helping to integrate
population-level processes more broadly into ecological research. This
symposium aims to highlight the emerging role of demographic tools as
bridges across ecological, spatial, and temporal scales. Specific topics
include evolutionary demography, communities and coexistence, species
ranges, conservation, environmental drivers of population dynamics, and
methodological advances."

Goals of symposium:

- Explicitly link back to the goals of the symposium:
- Explore ways in which demography intersects other areas of ecological and evolutionary research
- Identify gaps in ecological and evolutionary understanding that can be informed by an understanding of population-level processes
- Elucidate analytical tools and metrics that facilitate the integration of population-level processes into other ecological spatial and temporal scales (and vice versa)

Submitting as an "application note"(3000 words) to *[Methods in Ecology and evolution](http://www.methodsinecologyandevolution.org/view/0/authorGuidelines.html)*. Potential to contribute to a special Issue of BES journals aligned with their symposium [Demography Beyond The Population](http://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/events/current_future_meetings/demography-beyond-the-population-bes-annual-symposium/).
